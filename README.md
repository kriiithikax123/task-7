For this task, I used Google Chrome to inspect and manage browser extensions. I began by navigating to the extensions page by typing chrome://extensions in the address bar. This opened the extension manager where all currently installed extensions were listed. I carefully reviewed each extension to determine its purpose and whether it was necessary or safe to keep.

There were two extensions installed: Google Docs Offline and McAfee WebAdvisor. I recognized Google Docs Offline as a trusted Google tool that allows editing documents without internet access, so I decided to retain it. The second extension, McAfee WebAdvisor, is a security tool from McAfee that provides website safety ratings. However, after researching it online, I found mixed reviews — some users reported slow browser performance, while others mentioned data collection concerns. Additionally, I do not actively use McAfee antivirus, and this extension appeared to be automatically installed.

Based on this, I identified McAfee WebAdvisor as unnecessary for my usage and clicked the Remove button to uninstall it. After removal, I restarted the browser to ensure any changes took effect and checked for performance improvements. The browser felt slightly faster and cleaner without the unused extension.

This task helped me understand the importance of regularly reviewing installed browser extensions and how certain add-ons, even if not malicious, can affect browser speed and privacy. I learned how to evaluate extensions based on permissions, reviews, and personal need, and took appropriate action by removing one that wasn’t required.
